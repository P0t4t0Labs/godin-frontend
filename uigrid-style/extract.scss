// This is a super hacky file to extract sass variables into less.
// I've tried every single sass or sass2less converter or what have you,
// but nothing other than node-sass can read Bulma's sass files because
// they use a very new syntax.

// Set a class equal to the name of the less variable you'd like to set.
// Use an appropriate css property and assign a variable to it.
// Only ever assign a single property to the class.
// We're using ghetto regex to parse this.

  // Comes from $table-cell-border
